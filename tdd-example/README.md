# _Why_? ðŸ¤·


The **_objective_** of the application 
that will be created is to explain 
**_step by step_** the creation of an application 
using the **_TDD_**.<br />



# _What_? ðŸ’­

The TDD is a **_method or approach_** used in programming 
where the objective is to write a **_test_** (a function, a class or method) 
so that it fails, to be added later only the code necessary for the test to pass.


> We have built a _small counter application_ 
to be understood by all beginners. <br />
To build this tutorial we use the TDD method which is used in several languages.
The result of this _tutorial_ is much **simpler** 
to understand and has beyond the **step by step** has
the **complete code** of the application.


>To learn more about how TDD works and how it can be used, this repository has all the essential information: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd

# _Who_? ðŸ‘¥

This tutorial is intended for all people who are _learning_
more about **_Flutter_** and who are looking 
to learn how to use the **_TDD correctly_**.
It was made for all **beginners** without previous _experience/knowledge_.

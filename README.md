Extract the file and place the folder in directory "C:"<br />

This is the console that comes inside the folder in this case the Flutter console, can use to see which devices connected, create a project in Flutter.

In order to access Flutter commands without having to open this console, we can use the Windows prompt itself we need to add Flutter to the environment variables.<br />

You need to go to the bin folder and copy the path then go to the computer properties, then go to advanced system settings.

As you can see if you go to the windows prompt and run the command "flutter" it already appears.

 Now at the windows prompt if you run the command "flutter doctor" will check if there is anything left to install so that we can develop the applications with Flutter.

  If you need to install android studio here is the link:https://developer.android.com/studio <br />
  To install dart and flutter just go to the Android studio and press plugins and search for both. <br />
  After having everything installed just open the Android Studio that will appear "Start a new Flutter Project".

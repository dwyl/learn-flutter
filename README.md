## What is Flutter?

Flutter in an open Source SDK for creating high-performance mobile apps for IOS and Android.
The Flutter makes it easier for you to build user interfaces, while reducing the amount of code required to create and update your app.

## Dart Before Flutter?
Before you dive into Flutter you have to learn the programming language that is used to build Flutter apps, and that is Dart.

Extract the file and place the folder in directory "C:"<br />
It's probably best to create a folder in the directory like this.

This is the console that comes inside the folder in this case the Flutter console, can use to see which devices connected, create a project in Flutter.

In order to access Flutter commands without having to open this console, we can use the Windows prompt itself we need to add Flutter to the environment variables.<br />

You need to go to the bin folder and copy the path then go to the computer properties, then go to advanced system settings.

 Now at the windows prompt if you run the command "flutter doctor" will check if there is anything left to install so that we can develop the applications with Flutter.

  If you need to install android studio here is the link:https://developer.android.com/studio <br />
  To install dart and flutter just go to the Android studio and press plugins and search for both. <br />
  After having everything installed just open the Android Studio that will appear "Start a new Flutter Project".

  ## Scaffold class?
  
  Provides a framework which implements the basic material design visual layout structure of the Flutter app.
  Contais various functionality from giving an appbar, a floating button, a drawer, background color, bottom navigation bar and body.
  
  
  ### AppBar
  It defines what has to be displayed at the top of the screen.
  Has various properties like title,padding,brightness.
   
   ### Body
   It's the area below the Appbar and behind the buttons.
   Any widget in the body is positioned at the top left corner by default.
     
     
   ## FloatingActionButton
   
   Is a button displayed floating in the bottom right corner.
   We use this button to promote a primary action in the application.
      
   ## Drawer
   
   Is a panel displayed to the side of the body.
   One usually has to swipe left to right of right to left to access the drawer.
   It uses the Drawer properties which is a material design panel that slides from the edge of a Scaffold to show links in an application.
